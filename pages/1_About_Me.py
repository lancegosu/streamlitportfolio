    I was born and raised in California, a place blessed with some of the most beautiful weather on the planet. 
    Growing up in the Golden State fueled my passion for exploration, be it the bustling city life or the tranquility of 
    the redwood forests. This unique blend of experiences has not only shaped my appreciation for diversity but also 
    influences the creativity I bring to my work as a developer. From the Pacific shores to the tech hubs, California is 
    more than my home; it's a constant source of inspiration. ðŸŒžðŸŒ´

    In my past life, I spent over 8 years as a professional tennis coach, shaping the game and personal development of 
    more than 600 students. From empowering beginners to refining strategies for national-level players, each lesson was a
